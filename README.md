## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This is a project that has been some months in the making. So it was a training in reading code you've written weeks ago, restarting the train of thought each time you begin, adding in additional information as you found it. The html/css-core was written fluently. It's (as always), the validation and accessibility-part that leads me to different solutions each time.

- In fine-tuning the form (adding in all attributes, the required \*, CSS nesting, error states,...) I followed along with Kevin Powells' lessons on the [form](https://youtu.be/jJgNgNNHqjk?si=6oMBtEeXGWvsvCQt) and [form validation](https://youtu.be/h5qqmE83Tes?si=_-K_4a4GuFkaf1XU).
